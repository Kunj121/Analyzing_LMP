#As previously mentioned, 2022 exhibits first-order stochastic dominance (FOSD) with the highest daily average real-time LMP (Locational Marginal Price) across the observed years. Interestingly, this pattern does not align with the temperature data, as 2023 was generally warmer than 2022. One possible explanation for this inconsistency is that LMPs are more sensitive to short-term, extreme fluctuations rather than average seasonal temperatures. For instance, 2022 may have experienced more severe or abrupt cold spells—particularly during the winter months—which could have led to sharp spikes in electricity demand and, consequently, higher real-time LMPs.

The resulting graph is a three-dimensional density plot that illustrates how frequently specific combinations of temperature and LMP volatility occur. The peaks in the graph represent the highest density areas, indicating that these temperature-volatility combinations are the most common. Conversely, the valleys indicate lower-density regions where such combinations are less frequent.

#30 What do observe from plots, talk about relationship between price and weather. Is it linear? Descibe?


#In the graphs for Chicago and Milwaukee, the average temperature ranges from 0°F to 45°F. As temperature decreases, we observe a corresponding increase in LMP, suggesting a roughly linear relationship at first glance. In contrast, the graph for Corpus Christi shows a potentially exponential relationship. Here, temperatures range from 20°F to 80°F—about 25% greater in range compared to Chicago. Notably, when temperatures in Corpus Christi drop to around 20°F, Real-Time LMP spikes dramatically to nearly 2000, which may reflect the region’s limited infrastructure and preparedness for extreme cold weather events. Despite these regional differences, the overall patterns in the line graphs suggest that the data across the cities may have been drawn from similar underlying distributions.

#Each point on the graph represents the hourly difference in LMP prices in Chicago. Most of these differences cluster around zero, indicating that, for the majority of the time, hourly price changes are minimal—likely due to stable weather conditions. However, there are noticeable outliers where the hourly LMP shifts dramatically. These extreme changes may be driven by sudden and significant weather fluctuations. Notably, the data suggests that the winter months exhibit the largest day-over-day (DoD) weather changes, which could be contributing to heightened volatility in LMP during that season.

#33. We observe that the most significant changes in spread tend to occur during the winter months, likely due to more extreme and unpredictable weather patterns. Additionally, there is a noticeable increase in LMP volatility over the weekends compared to weekdays. This may be attributed to shifts in consumption patterns, as energy usage dynamics differ when people are at home rather than at work, potentially creating more demand uncertainty and pricing fluctuations.

#35. Between 2021 and 2023, the spread_ratio (day-over-day change in hourly Day-Ahead Locational Marginal Prices [DA LMP] between Chicago and Milwaukee) exceeded 1 on 8,860 hours, while the spread_ratio_ercot (analogous spread between Chicago and Corpus Christi, TX) exceeded 1 on 6,082 hours.

#This indicates that Chicago-Milwaukee price deviations were more frequent and/or more volatile compared to those between Chicago and Corpus Christi during this period. Since Milwaukee and Chicago are in closer geographic and market proximity (both within MISO), higher frequency of spread_ratio > 1 suggests that localized grid constraints, weather patterns, or demand variations caused more frequent shifts in LMP between these neighboring hubs.

#In contrast, the lower frequency of spread_ratio_ercot > 1 implies that the inter-market differences (MISO vs ERCOT) produced fewer but possibly larger or more structural spreads, potentially driven by broader system-level factors like regional generation mix, transmission bottlenecks, or regulatory differences.

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
